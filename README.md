## About

This is the source code for my 3rd year Cambridge University dissertation project. It is a **Texas Hold 'em poker-bot** which uses the **Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm**. 

To be perfectly honest, this project does *not* represent my best work. Check out any of my [other repositories](https://github.com/davidxmoody) for that. I simply wanted to upload this to prove I'd done it and also in case it might ever be of use to someone.

Unfortunately the project won't build in it's current state. Sorry about that. The bot runs as a plugin to [Poker Academy Pro](http://www.poker-academy.com/poker-software/) which I no longer have access to. [opentestbed](https://code.google.com/p/opentestbed/) may also work. 

The dissertation itself is probably the most important part. I recommend reading the *Preparation* section for what the project does and how it does it. The *Evaluation* section also has some interesting results and graphs in it.
